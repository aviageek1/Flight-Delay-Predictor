As someone that is extremely interested in flying, I play a lot of flight simulators. However, some of these flight simulators are not very detailed. No complicated autopilot to guide me down. Flying all by hand, I would often times misjudge my descent rate and ascent rate. Frustrated over always having bad approaches, I wished there was a calculator that could simply tell me my descent or ascent rate in feet/minute so that I could learn to judge it properly.

After taking two coding classes in my first year of college, I decided to make a celebatory project to showcase my newfound coding skills. Since I am majoring in Aerospace Engineering, I found it fitting to kill two birds with one stone and make my project around solving this flight simulator issue I had been having.

Voila, here is my solution!
